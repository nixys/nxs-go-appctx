# nxs-go-appctx

This Go package provides a tools to make Go applications context. With the `nxs-go-appctx` you may focus on your application logic instead of write an extensive and difficult system kits to allow your daemons work fine. `Nxs-go-appctx` designed to simplify create REST API applications.

## Features

- **Application context control**  
Most applications consist of goroutines that implements program functionality and context that contains a data (e.g. config option, database connections, etc) used at runtime. `Nxs-go-appctx` allows to control of the derived goroutines and keep context data up-to-dated over an application runtime.

- **Logging**  
`Nxs-go-appctx` uses the [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) logger created at the *init* stage and it's available in application at runtime. In accordance with context settings, log file can be changed after context reload. Also you may choose log format you wish.

- **Pid files**  
If the *pid file* path is set, the pid file with the program PID will be automatically created at the *init* and removed at the *terminate* stage. In accordance with context settings, pid file can be changed after context reload.

- **Reload signals**  
If the *reload signals* is set, every time application will receive specified signals, context data will be updated in accordance with *custom context* `Reload()` function.

- **Termination signals**  
If the *terminate signals* is set, every time application will receive specified signals, context data will be freed in accordance with  *custom context*`Free()` function and the application itself will be terminated.

- **Logrotate signals**  
If the *logrotate signals* is set, every time application will receive specified signals the log file will be reopened. It is useful for `logrotate` utility.

## Getting started

For better understanding the `nxs-go-appctx` see the example in [nxs-go-appctx-example-restapi](https://github.com/nixys/nxs-go-appctx-example-restapi).

### Setup nxs-go-appctx

Application that uses the `nxs-go-appctx` generally has structure described below.

![Nixys Application Context structure](docs/images/nxs-go-appctx.png)

**Main**

It's a root of the application repository. Besides a codebase helper files this directory consist of:

- `main.go`: may contains only a `main()` with call an `appctx.ContextInit()` function to create an *application context* (`appctx`) with necessary settings and one or more `appCtx.RoutineCreate()` calls to add *application routines*.

To work fine with `appctx` the `main()` must be able to process at least two channels:
- `ac.ExitWait()`: channel tells when an `appctx` is freed and application may be terminated. Usually it happens in following cases:
  - Function `appCtx.ContextTerminate()` called from any part of application
  - Application got the termination signal from system (e.g. `SIGTERM`)
  - Application context `appctx` encountered with an error while processing reload signal (e.g. `SIGHUP`) 

If you haven't a specific logic to process described channels you may use `defer appCtx.MainBodyGeneric()` in `main()`.

**Ctx**

*Custom context* it is a structure stores all data (such as config options, database connections, etc) used through the application. *Custom context* and all of its components describe in `ctx/` directory:

- `ctx/args.go`: defines a function for processing command line arguments, `Args` struct to store read values and one or more helper functions.
- `ctx/conf.go`: defines a function for processing config file, structure (may consist with some nested structures) to store read values from config file and one or more helper functions. It's useful to use [nxs-go-conf](https://github.com/nixys/nxs-go-conf) package to work with config files.
- `ctx/context.go`: defines the *custom context* struct and its three methods:
  - `Init()`: initiates application *custom context*. This function used for read config file, make connections for any external datasources and store this data into *custom context*.
  - `Reload()`: reloads application *custom context*. This function called in case if application receive reload signal (e.g. `SIGHUP`) and usually only close an external connections and call `Init()` to read updated config file and create new connections.
  - `Free()`: frees application *custom context*. This function used for free the *custom context* (e.g. close an external connections) before program termination.

**Routines**

*Application routines* (or just a *routines*) in `nxs-go-appctx` is a parts of application (i.e. workers) do the specific job such as exec HTTP server, cache daemons and etc. Use `appCtx.RoutineCreate()` call in `main` to create a new *routine*.

Each *routine* describes in separate package within the `routines/` directory and consist of `Runtime()` called from `main()` and may contain other helper functions if it's necessary. The *routine's* `Runtime()` function must have a handlers to catch data at least from two channels:
- `context runtime done()`: for notifications from `appctx` to terminate this *routine*.
- `context reload channel`: for notifications from `appctx` if *custom context* has been reloaded.

If the *routine* encountered with a fatal error it may call `appCtx.RoutineDoneSend()` before terminate to notify `appctx` and send appropriate exit status to `main()`.

Every *routine* interacts with any other part of application or external data only via *modules*. It also able use *api* and helper functions from *misc*.

**Modules**

*Modules* in `nxs-go-appctx` is a blocks responsible for specific logical elements of application.

Each *module* describes in separate package within the `modules/` directory and you may choose for them any structure you want.

For example, if your app has a `user` table in database with raw dataset such as `id`, `name`, `password` and you need to have complex processing of this data (e.g. find all user whose names match specifed regex), you need to create the *module* `modules/user/` with appropriate code.

*Module* must interact only with following application elements:
- Other modules
- Datasources
- Misc

**API**

This part of application describes REST API and consist of `RoutesSet()` function and handlers to process all requests and methods you need.

*API* must interact only with following application elements:
- Modules
- Misc

**Datasources**

*Datasources* contains a separate packages in `ds/` describes interaction with any external datasources you need to use such as DBs (eg. Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc), APIs (e.g. GitHub API, Kubernetes API, etc). The content of packages may has any structure you want.

*Datasources* must interact only with following application elements:
- Misc

**Misc**

*Misc* contain helper functions which used by any part of application.

*Misc* must interact only with following application elements:
- Other miscs
